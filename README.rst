mailproxy - POP/SMTP to Katzenpost proxy server
===============================================

This is a implementation of a proxy server that exposes a POP/SMTP interface
to Katzenpost based mix networks. It is intended to run on a user's localhost
to allow standard mail clients to send and receive mail over the mixnet.

To build the mailproxy see the 'daemons' repo:
