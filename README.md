### mailproxy - POP/SMTP to Katzenpost proxy server.
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

This is a implementation of a proxy server that exposes a POP/SMTP interface
to Katzenpost based mix networks.  It is intended to run on a user's localhost
to allow standard mail clients to send and receive mail over the mixnet.
